Title: Accommodation Data Analysis with Python

Description: This project demonstrates a step-by-step data analysis process using Python for analyzing accommodation data. The dataset contains information about various accommodations, including their locations, tags, telephone numbers, and URLs. The analysis includes exploring the distribution of accommodations by region, identifying common tags associated with accommodations, analyzing summary statistics for longitude and latitude, examining the distribution of telephone number lengths, analyzing tag frequencies, and exploring domain and top-level domain frequencies of URLs. The findings are visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries
